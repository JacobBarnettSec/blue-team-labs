# Blue Team Labs - SOC Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on blue team and SOC analyst projects designed to simulate real-world SOC workflows. Projects focus on:  

- Alert triage and investigation  
- Phishing analysis  
- Log review and incident documentation  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Browser-based threat hunting and OSINT enrichment  

All labs are performed using browser-based and open-source tools to demonstrate practical SOC skills.
