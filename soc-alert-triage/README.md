# SOC Alert Triage Simulation

This project simulates the role of a SOC analyst triaging a security alert generated by a SIEM/EDR platform. The investigation focuses on alert validation, evidence analysis, and determining whether escalation or remediation is required.

The goal of this simulation is to demonstrate practical alert-handling skills, including distinguishing false positives from true security incidents and documenting findings in a clear, professional manner.
