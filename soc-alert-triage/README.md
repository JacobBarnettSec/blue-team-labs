# SOC Alert Triage Simulation

This project simulates the role of a SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst triaging security alerts generated by a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform. The focus is on validating alerts, analyzing evidence, and determining whether escalation or remediation is required.

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate practical alert-handling skills as an entry-level SOC analyst (L1).  
- Distinguish between true positives and false positives in security alerts.  
- Document findings and recommended actions clearly and professionally.  
- Showcase the ability to follow SOC workflows and escalation procedures.

## Key Features
- Investigated multiple alerts of varying severity, including high-risk malware indicators, potential data exfiltration, and routine downloads from external repositories.  
- Practiced triage processes using a simulated SOC environment in TryHackMe.  
- Produced detailed observations, conclusions, and recommended actions for each alert in a structured report (`investigation-2.md`).  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Alert prioritization and triage workflow  
- Host, user, and network activity analysis  
- Identification of false positives vs. true security incidents  
- Documentation for SOC auditing and reporting  
- Professional incident escalation procedures
