# SOC Alert Triage Simulation

## Introduction
This project simulates the role of a SOC analyst triaging security alerts generated by a SIEM. The investigation focuses on alert validation, evidence analysis, and determining whether escalation or remediation is required. The goal is to demonstrate practical alert-handling skills, including distinguishing false positives from true security incidents and documenting findings in a clear, professional manner.

## Alert 1: Double-Extension File Creation

### Alert Details
- Alert Name: Double-Extension File Creation  
- Host: LPT-HR-009  
- User: S.Conway  
- Timestamp: Mar 21st 2025 at 13:58  
- Severity: High  
- Status: Closed  
- Verdict: True Positive  
- Process Name: chrome.exe  
- Target File: C:\Users\S.Conway\Downloads\cats2025.mp4.exe  
- File MotW URL: https://freecatvideoshd.monster/cats2025.mp4.exe  
- File MD5: 14d8486f3f63875ef93cfd240c5dc10b  

### Initial Observation
A high-severity alert triggered for the creation of a double-extension file, "cats2025.mp4.exe," on host LPT-HR-009 by user S.Conway. Double-extension files are commonly used in phishing and malware campaigns to disguise executables as safe files. After investigating process execution and file details in the SIEM, I determined this is a True Positive. Escalated to Tier 2 SOC for containment and further investigation.

### Investigation Steps
1. Prioritized the alert and selected it from the SOC queue.  
2. Assigned the alert to myself and moved it to "In Progress."  
3. Reviewed alert name, description, and fields.  
4. Checked for a workbook — none available, proceeded without it.  
5. Investigated activity in SIEM, analyzing process execution and file details.  
6. Made final verdict: True Positive.  
7. Escalated alert to Tier 2 SOC for containment and further investigation.

### Findings / Conclusion
The alert represents a true positive detection of a malicious double-extension file. Immediate escalation is required to prevent potential compromise of the endpoint or network.

### Recommended Action
- Escalate to Tier 2 SOC for containment and remediation.  
- Ensure affected endpoint is scanned and isolated as needed.  
- Document alert resolution in SIEM for auditing purposes.

## Alert 2: Potential Data Exfiltration

### Alert Details
- Alert Name: Potential Data Exfiltration  
- Host / Source Network: 192.168.45.66 / UK04/MEETINGROOM  
- User: Not specified  
- Timestamp: Mar 21st 2025 at 13:30  
- Severity: Critical  
- Status: Closed  
- Verdict: False Positive  
- Destination: *.zoom.us  
- Sent Data: 5.8 GB  
- Received Data: 5.2 GB  

### Initial Observation
A critical alert triggered for large data transfer (5.8 GB sent) from a single device to Zoom. Large data transfers can indicate potential data exfiltration, but the destination is a trusted platform commonly used for business purposes. Investigated activity in the SIEM and verified the transfer was performed by authorized onsite representatives as part of normal workflow. Determined as a False Positive; no escalation required.

### Investigation Steps
1. Prioritized and assigned the alert, moved it to "In Progress."  
2. Reviewed alert name, description, and metadata including host, source network, and data volumes.  
3. Checked destination context: *.zoom.us is a trusted business platform.  
4. Investigated activity in SIEM; verified transfer was part of normal workflow for onsite representatives.  
5. Checked for a workbook — none present.  
6. Evaluated whether activity represented malicious exfiltration.  
7. Determined alert is a False Positive.  
8. No escalation required.

### Findings / Conclusion
The alert represents a large but legitimate data transfer to a trusted business platform. No evidence of malicious exfiltration was found.

### Recommended Action
- Close alert as False Positive.  
- Monitor for repeated suspicious activity.  
- Document decision in SIEM for auditing purposes.

## Alert 3: Download from GitHub Repository

### Alert Details
- Alert Name: Download from GitHub Repository  
- Host: LPT-IT-063  
- User: G.Chandler  
- Timestamp: Mar 21st 2025 at 13:02  
- Severity: Low  
- Status: Closed  
- Verdict: False Positive  
- Accessed URL: https://github.com/facebook/react  
- Source Network: VPN/DEVELOPERS  

### Initial Observation
A low-severity alert triggered for a file download from GitHub by user G.Chandler. GitHub can host both safe and malicious content, so verification is required. Scanned the downloaded repository using multiple malware detection services and confirmed it was legitimate. Determined as a False Positive; no escalation required.

### Investigation Steps
1. Prioritized and selected the alert.  
2. Assigned alert to myself and moved it to "In Progress."  
3. Reviewed alert description and fields, including URL, host, user, and network.  
4. Checked for a workbook — none available.  
5. Investigated activity in SIEM and scanned the downloaded file with multiple malware detection services.  
6. Determined alert is a False Positive — file was legitimate and safe.  
7. No escalation required.

### Findings / Conclusion
The alert represents legitimate activity and is classified as a False Positive.

### Recommended Action
- Close alert as False Positive.  
- Maintain awareness for downloads from external repositories.  
- Document decision in SIEM for auditing purposes.
