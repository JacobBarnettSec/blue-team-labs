# Phishing Investigation #1

## Email Overview
- Reported by: User
- Date received: Unknown
- Subject: New Voice Message
- Sender address: Unknown (spoofed voicemail notification)

## Initial Assessment
This email appears suspicious because it claims to be a new voicemail from an unknown number and includes an attachment that prompts the user to download a file. The Office 365 logo is used to make the email look legitimate, and the attachment ultimately leads to a page disguised as an Outlook login, which is a common phishing tactic to capture credentials.
